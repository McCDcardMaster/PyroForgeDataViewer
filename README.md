**A cobbled-together .win file viewer from an era when the "Constructor ToolMaker" engine didn't even have a name.**

### ðŸ§¨ What Even Is This?  
This project is a monument to the **"DIY before anyone notices"** era. Written in one caffeine-fueled night to parse mysterious `.win` files from a prototype engine later known as **Constructor ToolMaker**. Yes, even mentioning the engine here is an anachronismâ€”back then, we just called it *"that internal tool thingy"*.

### ðŸ”¥ Features (or "Fixes", as We Call Them)  
- **Ultra-brutalist interface**: Because design is for cowards.  
- **.win file decoding**: If you know what these are, congratulationsâ€”you're part of the problem.  
- **Spaghetti-code labyrinth**: Ask "why?" and we'll answer "because the deadline was yesterday".  
- **Zero documentation**: You're reading this README, right? Then it's working as intended.
